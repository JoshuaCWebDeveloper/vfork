The mix-net comes with a well documented demonstrator which can be
configured in many ways to illustrate the features of the mix-net. The
demo is found in ./demo/mixnet (or ./vfork/demo/mixnet if you
installed the metapackage containing GMPMEE and JGMPMEE).

Please note that the demonstrator assumes that you have copied
.vfork_env to your home directory. See the README file in the
demo directory for more information.
