# There is a bug in the JDK that makes
# SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG", "SUN") always seed itself from
# /dev/random. Thus, if it blocks, then getInstance blocks as well. It
# does not suffice to use -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom to
# avoid this problem. THE WEIRD-LOOKING DOT IN THE PATH IS REALLY
# NEEDED.

# The JVM_DATAMODEL is replaced by -d32 or -d64, by an m4 macro. The
# value used depends on the native wordlength. This is *necessary* in
# some OS, e.g., Solaris, since the JVM otherwise tries to execute in
# 32-bit mode instead of 64-bit mode. It is not needed in Linux or
# FreeBSD.

# Extract the name of this shell script without its path.
