                       VERIFICATUM (FULL)

This is a meta-package that builds and installs GMPMEE, JGMPMEE, and
Verificatum. Please follow the instructions of verificatum/README, but
execute the commands in this directory. This will install everything
you need.

If you are lazy and adventurous you may instead try a suitable script
from the .lazysetup subdirectory. These are scripts that attempt to
build and install everything you need. The script should be executed
from the top directory, e.g.:

   ./lazysetup/ubuntu_10.04

Currently this ONLY WORKS FOR 64-bit platforms due to a bug in libtool
that performs incorrect relinking on 32-bit platforms. If you are on a
32-bit platform, then you should make and install each sub-package
separately and in the order GMPMEE, JGMPMEE, and Verificatum.
